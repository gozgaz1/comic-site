                    <h2>Why am I here?</h2>
                    <p>Good question. I'm not sure what brought you here, but it must've been either a mistake or a recommendation. Either way you're here. Please enjoy my site.</p>
                    <h2>So what do you have in store?</h2>
                    <p>Nothing much. This is simply a personal project just to host my own comic somewhere. The main feature is the comic section, so please give it a try.</p>
                    <h2>Wait, comic? Are you like a comic artist or a mangaka?</h2>
                    <p>No, it's just a hobby.</p>
                    <h2>Do you do fanart?</h2>
                    <p>Here and there. Out and around. Round and about. Hither and thither. Too and Fro. Back and forth. Up and down. In and out. Over and under. Hippity-hoppity. Round the corner. 
                    Over the river and through the woods. Lickety split. Clockin' the jizz. Grinding the ax. Up to no good. Lippin' the bud. Good n' plenty. Lollygagging around. Makin' the rounds. Paintin' the town red. Packing a load. 
                    Hugging a tree. Skinnin' the dogs. Skip to my lou. Sowin' my oats. Passin' the stones. Shootin' the breeze. Jumpin' the fence. Humpin' the horse. Dancin' a jig. Spinnin' it is. Sippin' the cider. Flexin' the pecks.
                    Groovin' my do. Packin' the heat. Lickin' the chicken. Pinchin' the panties. Docie doe-- <b><i>Yeah I do.</i></b>

                    <p>I usually play fighting games. Other times I play JRPG or short indie games, various titles and genres (aside from shooters). And some Dragalia Lost.</p>
                    <h2>Oooh fighting games. What fighting games do you play?</h2>
                    <p>Anything you throw at me really. I main GG (currently GGST and some Rev2, but +R is fine), BBCF and any other fighting games you wanna introduce me to.</p>
                    <h2>You said you built this site for the comic. Are you a programmer as well?</h2>
                    <p>Yes, I'm a programmer by day. Art is just a hobby.</p>
                    <h2>Do you read manga or watch anime?</h2>
                    <p>Sometimes. I watched a bunch of older stuff mostly.?</p>
